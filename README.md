# Tmux ZSH Environment

Tmux includes an `update-environment` command that means that any new shells
recieve the variables in `update-environment` when they are loaded. However,
existing shells do not recieve these variables, meaning that things like
`DISPLAY` become out-of-date when sshing into a machine and connecting to an
existing session.

This ZSH plugin adds a lightweight preexec hook function that runs on every new
prompt/execution, and updates the current shell environement with any variables
loaded in the tmux `show-environment` array (this includes only those variables
that were both set by `update-environment` and set in the calling environment).

By default, tmux updates the following variables:

```shell
DISPLAY SSH_ASKPASS SSH_AUTH_SOCK SSH_AGENT_PID SSH_CONNECTION WINDOWID XAUTHORITY
```

If these look good to you, this plugin will work out of the box to keep those
updated, if not, you can just add the following line to your `~/.tmux.conf`:

```shell
set -g update-environment "DISPLAY SSH_CONNECTION XAUTHORIT"
```
